## 📖 Project Overview  
The **Communications System** is a **Java-based client–server application** designed for large organizations to enable **secure, text-only messaging**.  
It supports both:  
- **Synchronous (real-time)** chat  
- **Asynchronous (delayed)** chat  

Users can communicate through **private one-to-one conversations** or **group chats**.  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
- 🔑 **Role-Based Access** – Separate GUIs for IT administrators (with monitoring) and general users (messaging only).  
- 📝 **Conversation Logging** – All messages stored on the server for auditing and compliance.  
- 🔔 **Notifications** – Alerts for new incoming messages.  
- 🌍 **Cross-Platform Compatibility** – Runs on any system with Java using TCP/IP sockets.  
- ⚡ **Lightweight** – No external frameworks, databases, or web components.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Java (SE 8 or later)**  
- **TCP/IP Socket Programming**  
- **Swing GUI Toolkit** (for user interfaces)  
- **JUnit** (for unit testing)  
- **GitHub** (for version control & collaboration)

## Project Constraints
