Project Overview :
The Communications System is a Java-based clientâ€“server application designed for large organizations to enable secure, text-only messaging. The system supports both synchronous (real-time) and asynchronous (delayed) chat, with options for private one-to-one conversations and group messaging.

Key features include:

Role-based access with distinct GUIs for IT administrators and general users.

Conversation logging stored on the server for auditing and compliance.

Notifications for new messages.

Cross-platform compatibility via TCP/IP sockets (no external frameworks or databases).

This project demonstrates software engineering principles through requirements documentation (SRS), design diagrams, implementation in Java, unit testing with JUnit, and version control using GitHub.
